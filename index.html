                                                    A Dutch client was a talented florist yet very unhappy working as a bar manager . To complicate things she had become romantically involved with her boss who was prone to undermine her self confidence on professional basis but also rocked her self esteem. Childcare was a problem due to the unsocial hours. I supported her in finding her true passion in life and discover her vocational strengths. This is turn led to securing a role as flower importer from Holland to numerous supermarkets. A home based occupation brought her closer to her children and gave her the time and confidence to find a new partner.

                                                My client and partner had been hit hard by the recession and both made redundant. With a family to raise and bills to pay, finding suitable work was causing difficulties in their relationship. Whilst my client had secured a part-time job her husband was reluctantly sending off job applications that she selected for him, based on a strict criteria of salary, proximity and hours. Her true passion was to pursue training to become a web designer so she could work from home and be present for her children. Whist he wanted to return to the licensing trade.Together we devised a payment plan for the course and an incentive for the husband to find suitable employment. Within weeks the £5 a month offer for the course was accepted. She gave her blessing for her husband to manage a bar and on the nights he worked she completed her college work. Both objectives were achieved and harmony was restored. </div>

                                        <span>  <i class="fa fa-quote-left "></i> &nbsp; </span> Having had previous coaches and mentors, throughout my career, often the primary focus was for the mentor/coach(s) objective to put on their CV’s, rather than developing the mentee. Lisa was different her only objective was to get me through the promotion process. In many mentor/mentee relationships is the problematic issue of been accessible which I had often experienced, In Lisa’s case access was easily available which made the whole rapport building so much easier.
                                    </p>
                                    <p> Lisa gave me advice and guidance in a encouraging manner way in that she had belief in my abilities to succeed, this boosted my self confidence. More importantly and as I look back now she gave me the opportunities and opened a number of doors which previous mentors had only suggested. The examples were regular meetings and discussions with the ACPO team and Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) which increased my level of awareness of strategic issues, also giving me feedback from their perspective. </p>
                                    <p> Lisa not only provided advice but set goals and gave me the opportunity to develop from experiential learning to chair meetings that addressed strategic issues and were constantly challenging my abilities. This again not only boosted my confidence but she also ensured that my skills were “showcased”. This became my stepping stone for further promotion within a very short period of time, working at HMIC performing the role of lead staff officer, raising my profile regionally and nationally.</p>
                                    <p> Lisa is without any doubt the best mentor I had in 30 years of my policing career, her personality, character, commitment but above she delivered what she said. Once again thanks Lisa, wishing you all the best in new career. Vijay Singh Associate Inspector Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary.

                                    <span>  <i class="fa fa-quote-left "></i> &nbsp; </span> &nbsp; Detective Superintendent Lisa Griffin as I knew her when I met her was a well known and a highly respected officer with the West Yorkshire Police Force. She had an exemplary record over her years of service and was a model police officer with criminal investigatory skills. She had studied psychology and had a full appreciation of the value of psychology within both operational and training issues. She attended the University of Huddersfield where she gave an entertaining and enlightening talk to the assembled study body with combined interests in both psychology and crime. As many psychology students are women it was both refreshing and inspirational to hear from a woman who had successfully combined both the role of both the police officer, wife and mother. In talking to her personally I was impressed by Lisa's care and humanity, even to people who had committed to serious acts of a criminal nature. Her warmth and humanity shone out of her talk as well. I was also fortunate enough to see Lisa within the training environment and I would highly recommend her for her interpersonal and communicative skills in guiding those with training needs. Knowing what I know now I would strongly recommend Lisa for any role which required explanation of the SIO (Senior Investigating Officer) role, criminal investigation and finally as an inspiration to women in both business and government bodies.
