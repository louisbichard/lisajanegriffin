Lisa was different her only objective was to get me through the promotion process. Lisa has great communication skills and this helped build our rapport. In many mentor/mentee relationships is the problematic issue of been accessible which I had often experienced, In Lisa’s case access was easily available which made the whole rapport building so much easier. Lisa gave me advice and guidance in a encouraging manner way in that she had belief in my abilities to succeed, this boosted my self confidence. More importantly and as I look back now she gave me the opportunities and opened a number of doors which previous mentors had only suggested. The examples were regular meetings and discussions with the ACPO team and Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) which increased my level of awareness of strategic issues, also giving me feedback from their perspective. Lisa not only provided advice but set goals and gave me the opportunity to develop from experiential learning to chair meetings that addressed strategic issues and were constantly challenging my abilities. This again not only boosted my confidence but she also ensured that my skills were “showcased”. This became my stepping stone for further promotion within a very short period of time, working at HMIC performing the role of lead staff officer, raising my profile regionally and nationally. Lisa is without any doubt the best mentor I had in 30 years of my policing career, her personality, character, commitment but above she delivered what she said. Once again thanks Lisa, wishing you all the best in new career. Vijay Singh Associate Inspector Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary. &nbsp; <i class="fa fa-quote-right "></i>

                    <p><i class="fa fa-quote-left "></i> &nbsp; I have known Lisa Griffin for 5 years. During that period I have conducted a number of prosecutions arising out of investigations carried out under Lisa’s direction as Senior Investigating Officer. Those have included the prosecution of a number of men for murder and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice arising out of a fatal shooting in public in Leeds (R. v Afzal Arif and others) and the prosecution on charges of manslaughter and other offences of a woman who starved her child to death and then stored his mummified body in her bedroom for a number of years (R. v Amanda Hutton). The cases have all been highly complex both in factual and scientific terms. Lisa’s quality of investigation has always been of a very high quality, involving resourceful and intelligent lines of investigation and the effective deployment of resources. I know that she has the confidence of all of the senior lawyers with whom she has worked. Lisa is an exeptional S.I.O with great experience and is ideally placed to train future officers for that role. &nbsp; <i class="fa fa-quote-right "></i>
